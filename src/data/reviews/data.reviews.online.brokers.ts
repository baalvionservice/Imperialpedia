        "Fidelity and Robinhood are both excellent for beginners. Fidelity has better research tools and customer service; Robinhood has a simpler interface. If you plan to hold long-term and want guidance, start with Fidelity. If you just want to start investing quickly with a clean app, Robinhood works.",
